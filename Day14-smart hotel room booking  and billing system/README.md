step1:the program starts by including the standard input/output library. It then declares variables to store the number of customers, total revenue, total rooms booked, and the highest and lowest bill amounts. The program prompts the user to enter the total number of customers. Step 2: Loop through each customer to get details and calculate the bill A for loop iterates for each customer. Inside the loop, variables for the current customer's details and bill are declared. The program prompts for the customer's name, room type, and number of days. Based on the room type, the base fare is calculated Step 3: Add additional services and apply discount The program asks the user if they want to add services (Breakfast, Wi-Fi, Gym). If the user enters 'Y' or 'y', the corresponding service cost is added to services_cost. The sub-total is calculated as the sum of the base fare and services cost. A 10% discount is applied if the sub-total (before GST) exceeds ₹10,000. Step 4: Calculate GST and final bill, then display individual bill A 12% GST is applied to the sub-total after the discount. The final bill is calculated by adding the GST. The program then prints the detailed bill for the current customer. The total_rooms_booked, total_revenue, highest_bill, and lowest_bill are updated. Step 5: Display the final hotel summary After the loop for all customers is complete, the program prints the final hotel summary, including the total rooms booked, total revenue, highest bill, and lowest bill
