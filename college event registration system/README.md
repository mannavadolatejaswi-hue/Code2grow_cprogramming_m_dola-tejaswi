1. Menu keeps repeating using while(1) until the user selects 0 to exit.
2. Students, events, and registrations are all stored in arrays, and counters keep track of how many entries are added.
3. Before registering, the program checks if the student ID and event ID exist using loops.
4. If both IDs are valid, the registration is saved, otherwise it shows "Invalid ID".
