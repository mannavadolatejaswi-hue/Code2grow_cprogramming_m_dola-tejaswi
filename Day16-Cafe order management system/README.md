DAY16-Cafe order management system
This program manages café orders by showing a fixed menu, taking multiple customer orders, and calculating their total bills.
It uses 1D arrays, loops, and conditional statements to track item quantities and revenue.
Finally, it displays the total revenue, total items sold, and the most/least ordered items.
